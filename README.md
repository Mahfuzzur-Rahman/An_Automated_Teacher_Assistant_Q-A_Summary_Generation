# An Automated Teacher Assistant: Q&A, Keywords and Summary Generation

The effective tool, Automatic Question Generator immediately creates high-quality questions from any text of your choice. The application uses the most advanced AI & ML algorithms and is helpful for training and assessment in business and education. We must look at the summary and keywords of the question to determine its major theme.  Additionally, it is crucial in teaching areas to extract the summary and keywords of student responses as well. To achieve my project's objective, I therefore used transformers to generate questions, keywords, and summaries.




## Roadmap

- Generate summary of given text with pre-trained T5 model

- Generate keywords from summary with KeyBERT model

- Generate questions with pretrained T5 model

- Take the question answer's as input

- Generate summary and keywords of answer script for further procedure


## How the app works

It accepts text as input first. Afterward, provide a text summary and identify 10 keywords. The next stage produces 10 questions based on the summary and keywords. You can submit the answer script for any one of the 10 questions by selecting it from the list. The application will produce a summary of the answerÂ and keywords. These two components will assist the teacher in future scoring.
